# Environment setup

## This setup is for MacOS users.

## For the course you'll need:

- Python 3 
- Google Cloud account (https://console.cloud.google.com/)
- SDK - Google Cloud CLI (https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install-sdk)
- Docker with docker-compose (https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- Terraform (https://www.terraform.io/downloads)
- CLI for Postgres (brew install pgcli)
- wget (brew install wget): WGET is a free tool to crawl websites and download files via the command line. More avout wget you van read here

In this week we worked on the integration of Docker and PostgreSQL in the context of building a data pipeline. The content is structured as follows:

1. **Introduction to Docker:**
   - Explanation of the need for Docker.
   - Creating a simple data pipeline within Docker.


docker run -it \

  -e POSTGRES_USER="root" \

  -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD="root" \

  -e POSTGRES_DB="ny_taxi" \

  -v "./ny-taxi-volume:/var/lib/postgresql/data" \

  -p 5432:5432 \

  postgres:13

  - Connect to it:


pgcli -h localhost -p 5432 -u root -d ny_taxi


- And check whatâ€™s there. For now it is going to be empty.

2. **Ingesting NY Taxi Data to Postgres:**
   - Running Postgres locally using Docker.
   - Utilizing pgcli for connecting to the database.
   - Exploration of the NY Taxi dataset.
   - Ingesting data into the Postgres database.

3. **Connecting pgAdmin and Postgres:**
   - Introduction to the pgAdmin tool.
   - Docker networks setup.
   - Steps for registering and creating a server in pgAdmin.

4. **Putting the Ingestion Script into Docker:**
   - Conversion of a Jupyter notebook to a Python script.
   - Parametrization of the script using argparse.
   - Dockerization of the ingestion script.

5. **Running Postgres and pgAdmin with Docker-Compose:**
   - Explanation of the need for Docker-compose.
   - Configuration of a Docker-compose YAML file.
   - Running multiple containers simultaneously using `docker-compose up`.

### All video how to do this you can find here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3MmuxUbc_hJed7dXYoJw8DoCuVHhGEQb

6. **Create GCP account:**
Create a Google Cloud account: https://console.cloud.google.com/

7. **Install Terraform and GCP CLI:**
Install Terraform: https://www.terraform.io/downloads

Install Google Cloud SDK: https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install-sdk

8. **Deploy & delete GCP resources with Terraform:**
### Set up GCP credentials:

- Creating and managing service account keys

### Write Terraform configuration files:

- Create a main.tf and variables.tf files with your GCP resources.

- Initialize Terraform and apply changes:

terraform init

terraform apply

- Delete resources when done:

terraform destroy

### Remember to replace placeholders such as your_username, your_password, your_database, your_data.csv, your-gcp-project-id and adjust configurations according to your needs.
